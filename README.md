Development Process
-------------------

Pretty much code and chill. I love to program, and plan to actively develop Pricecoin. This originally 
started as a challenge from my cousin after multiple discussions on cryptocurrency. Lots of late nights
and dedication is what makes this coin what it is today. 

The `master` branch is regularly built and tested, but is not guaranteed to be
completely stable.
